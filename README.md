# Finetuining large language model
 Finetuning a large language model is the process of adapting a pretrained model to perform a specific task by trainging it with your own data.its like customizing it for a particular job.
 when you are finetuning a large language model you need to remember some important points.
 1. Fine-tuning requires more technical expertise than using an LLM out-of-the-box.
 2. It can be computationally expensive, especially for large models and datasets.
 3. Too little data can lead to overfitting, where the model performs well on the training data but poorly on unseen examples.
 4. Fine-tuning can sometimes introduce biases present in the training data.
 5. Finetining large language model need much more gpu power than usual and take a long time to traing because of the size of the model.

In this project i used Falcon-7b which is a quite famouse large language model with 7 billion parameters.At first you need know some key characteristics of falcon-7b
1. Causal Decoder-only architecture: This design allows for efficient generation of text and code, making it ideal for tasks like creative writing, translation, and code completion.
2. RefinedWeb and curated corpora training: Trained on a massive dataset of 1,500B tokens from RefinedWeb enhanced with curated corpora, it boasts a strong understanding of natural language and the real world.
3. Finetuning available: The model can be further fine-tuned for specific tasks with additional training on smaller, task-specific datasets.
4. Hugging Face integration: Available on Hugging Face, a popular platform for NLP research and development, facilitating easy access and experimentation.

However, fine-tuning LLMs is very much challenging. The first barrier is the hardware limitation. LLMs are large because of their large amount of parameters. They have billions of parameters that require substantial computational resources for training. This means that fine-tuning LLMs often requires access to high-end hardware, which may not be readily available to all researchers and developers. This hardware limitation often acts as a barrier, causing a general reluctance to fine-tune LLMs.

With the help of low rank addaption (LoRA) we can solve this problem and train our llm efficiently.But first we need to understand what is LoRA and how its work-

Low-Rank Adaptation (LoRA) is a technique designed to make the fine-tuning process more efficient and accessible. LoRA introduces a low-rank matrix that is added to the pre-existing weight matrix of the model during the fine-tuning process. This low-rank matrix is much smaller than the original weight matrix, making it easier and faster to update during training.

####Mathematical Concepts Related to LoRA
Understanding LoRA requires a grasp of certain mathematical concepts, particularly those related to matrix operations. LoRA involves the addition of a low-rank matrix to the weight matrix of the model. A low-rank matrix is a matrix in which the number of linearly independent rows or columns is less than the maximum possible. In other words, it’s a matrix that can be factored into the product of two smaller matrices.

The concept of rank is crucial here. In linear algebra, the rank of a matrix is the maximum number of linearly independent rows or columns in the matrix. A low-rank matrix, therefore, is one where this number is as small as possible. This property of low-rank matrices is what makes them computationally efficient to work with, and it’s the reason why they’re used in LoRA.

The beauty of LoRA, or Low-Rank Adaptation, lies in its elegant simplicity and its profound impact on the training of Large Language Models (LLMs). The core concept of LoRA revolves around an equation that succinctly summarizes how a neural network adapts to specific tasks during training. Let’s break down this equation:
